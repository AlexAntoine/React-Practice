Section 4 video 22 - user component is not working as it should 7:28

Take note of this. You are probably going to need this later

Simple answer is you don't use a render prop function any more.

So you would simply do..

              <Route
                path={`/user/:login`}
                element={
                  <User getUser={this.getUser} user={user} loading={loading} />
                }
              />
You would only use render props here so that we can spread the <Route /> props to the component, so that you get access to some special props in User.js such as the match object for getting the route params.
In place of accessing the match object we now have a useParams hook.

However you can only use hooks in function components. So you will have to convert the User component to a function component.

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'
 
function User({ getUser, loading, user: { name } }) {
  const { login } = useParams()
 
  useEffect(() => {
    getUser(login)
  }, [])
 
  return <div>{name}</div>
}
 
export default User
The app does get refactored to use function components later anyway.

Still working on find  the solution. I am probably going to have to 
turn it into a functional component or maybe just continue on until he 
switches to modern react with useEffects and hooks.
                                                                  
onto section 5 - hopefully refactoring all this will get it to working

getting user component is still not showing. 
onto video 29 section 5 - still unable to display user component UI

onto video 31 section 5

still working on video 31 - I had to fix and error 3:28
